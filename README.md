# Network Simulator 
_a simulator for testing [secure scuttlebutt](https://ssb.nz) implementations against each other_

## Goals
The network simulator should:
* be a tool to measure performance metrics before & after partial replication
* be reusable by other scuttlebutts for verifying changes & debugging situationsâ€”without requiring any build step to run the tool
* be flexible enough to add new types of peers (e.g. rust)
* provide assurance + insurance that the bedrock of scuttlebutt works as intended

## Usage
```sh
netsim generate <ssb-fixtures-output> 
netsim run --spec netsim-test.txt path-to-sbot1 path-to-sbot2 ... path-to-sbotn
``` 

The `netsim` utility has two commands: 
* `netsim generate` consumes output generated by
  [`ssb-fixtures`](https://github.com/ssb-ngi-pointer/ssb-fixtures) and outputs a _netsim-adapted_
  ssb-fixtures folder, and an automatically generated netsim test file
* `netsim run` runs the specified netsim test file using the specified sbot implementations

_**Note**: when passing `--flags`_

_Always pass flags directly after a command, and **before** regular arguments. You can 
pass flags as either `-flag` or `--flag`._

### Downloading
To get started quickly, [download a netsim release](https://github.com/ssb-ngi-pointer/netsim/releases).

### SSB Fixtures
When auto-generating a netsim test, netsim makes use of pre-generated [ssb-fixtures](https://github.com/ssb-ngi-pointer/ssb-fixtures)
to:
* generate source identities and their public keypair
* determine the follow graph
* the amount of peers in the simulation, and the total amount of messages

The `netsim` utility, however, operates on output _adapted_ from a given `ssb-fixtures` dump.
The adapted fixtures are generated by the `netsim generate` tool. If you only want to generate an
adapted fixtures, and no test file, run:

```sh
netsim generate --no-test-script <ssb-fixtures-output>
```

### Learn more
For more options:
```sh
netsim generate -h
netsim run -h
``` 

For more on authoring netsim commands: 
* [`commands.md`](./docs/commands.md) 
* [`ssb-netsim`](https://github.com/ssb-ngi-pointer/ssb-netsim), the nodejs helper library 
* [caveats & edgecases](./docs/caveats.md) learn about gotchas surrounding testing of specific ssb implementations

There's also a [tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md) that demonstrates fixture generation. Finally, you can
always peek at the [original design doc](./docs/initial-design-doc.md) if you are curious to see how
things began.

## Example
Say we want to test an sbot implementation in `~/code/ssb-server`, just to make sure the basics
are still working.

First, we write a netsim test called `basic-test.txt`:
```m68k
# booting
enter peer
hops peer 1
enter server
hops server 1

start peer ssb-server
start server ssb-server
post server
post server
follow peer server
follow server peer
connect peer server
waituntil peer server@latest
stop peer
```

Now, let's run it:
```sh
netsim run --spec basic-test.txt ~/code/ssb-server
```

**Note:** the folder containing the sbot implementation, `ssb-server`, and the `start`
command's last operand are the same. If you want to run more sbots in the same test, just add
them onto the `netsim run` invocation, while making sure to match the folder name with
`start`'s operand.

### Building
If you want to build the code yourself: 

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ssb-ngi-pointer/netsim
cd netsim/cmd/netsim
go build
./netsim
```

For the unbundled netsim utilities, see the
[`cmd/`](https://github.com/ssb-ngi-pointer/netsim/tree/main/cmd) folder.

## Simulation Shims
Before you run netsim against an sbot implementation, make sure you have a `sim-shim.sh` script
in the root of the implementation. Simulation shims encapsulate implementation-specific details &
procedures such as: ingesting a [`log.offset`](https://github.com/flumedb/flumelog-offset)
file, passing `hops` and `caps` settings to the underlying sbot, and other details.

The `sim-shim.sh` script is passed, and should use, the following arguments and environment variables:

```sh
DIR="$1"
PORT="$2"
# the following env variables are always set from netsim:
#   ${CAPS}   the capability key / app key / shs key
#   ${HOPS}   a integer determining the hops setting for this ssb node
# if ssb-fixtures are provided, the following variables are also set:
#   ${LOG_OFFSET}  the location of the log.offset file to be used
#   ${SECRET}      the location of the secret file which should be copied to the new ssb-dir
``` 

For go and nodejs examples of sim-shims, see [`sim-shims/`](./sim-shims).

**Note:** the file must be named `sim-shim.sh` for the netsim to work.

## Required muxrpc calls
In order to test different implementations against each other, netsim makes heavy use of
Secure Scuttlebutt's [`muxrpc`](https://github.com/ssb-js/muxrpc) calls. For a brief primer, [see
the protocol guide](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/#rpc-protocol).

Currently, the following calls are required to be implemented before an ssb implementation is
testable in netsim:

**Essential**
* `createLogStream` 
* `createHistoryStream`
* `whoami`
* `publish`
* `conn.connect`
* `conn.disconnect`

**Extras**
* `friends.isFollowing` used by `isfollowing` / `isnotfollowing`
